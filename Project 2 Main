##Executive Summary
----------------


***
*Loading in our libraries and the Dataset*
```{r}
library(tidyr)
library("dplyr")
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
data = read.csv("data/P2, Student_data_standard.csv")
data2 = read.csv("data/P2, Student_data_advanced.csv")
```


*Classification of each Variable*

```{r}
#Dimensions of the data#
dim(data)
#Structure of the data#
str(data)

#Dimensions of the data#
dim(data2)
#Structure of the data#
str(data2)
```

***

* **Year**: The year studied (2012-2017, both semesters combiend).
* **Domestic/Intl**: Domestic or Internation student.
* **Mode**: A few sentences from a sommelier describing the wine's taste, smell, look, feel, etc.
* **Gender**: Gender of student. For anonymity, the students with neither are coded as female. 
This is the same approach used by the Department of Education.
* **Mode**: Full time (18+ credit points) or part time.
* **Age**: the age band the student falls under: Under 18, 19-21, 22-25, and over 25.
* **Unit of Study**: Name of unit of study. Arbitary unit names used for anonimity and operating under the assumption that 
these names relate to a junior unit of study offered by the School of Mathematics and Statistics between 2012 and 2017.
* **Unit of Study Level**: Study level: fundamental, mainstream or advanced.
* **Unit of Study Grade**: Final grade: FA (0-49), PS (50-64), CR (65-74), DI (75-84), and HD (85-100).
For anonimity, other grade descriptions (eg: discontinuations, withdrawals, absent fails) have been removed.
* **Count**: Number of grades with the preceding attributes.

##Part 1: Comparison between Gender and Grades, for a specific Unit of Study over the years 2012 - 2017?

##Part 2: 
#Is there a relationship between the proportion of people who didn't fail in fundamental units and the year those units were taught
```{r}
#NOTE: work in progress, subject to change

#Exploration of Data

fundamental = data %>% filter(Unit.of.Study.Level == "Fundamental")

notFailed = fundamental %>% filter(Unit.of.Study.Grade != "FA") %>% group_by(Year) %>% summarise(NF = sum(Count))

total = fundamental %>% group_by(Year) %>% summarise(ALL = sum(Count))

temp = merge(notFailed, total, by = "Year")

proportion = temp %>% group_by(Year) %>% summarise(Prop = NF/ALL)

ggplot(proportion, aes(x=Year, y=Prop)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()

#Is this relationship linear?
#TODO
ggplot(proportion, aes(x=Year, y=Prop)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = lm)

#Is this difference statistically significant 
#TODO
#Linear Model
l = lm(notFailed$NF~total$ALL)

#Adding residual column
proportion$r <- resid(l)

ggplot(proportion,  aes(x=Prop, y=r)) + geom_point()

```


Sina
##3:3. *What is the student count for each year in unit A?*
# What is the relationships between the years (in unit A) and the number of students enrolled?

```{r}
#Filtering data to only consider the students studying Unit A
filter1 = filter(standard, Unit.of.Study == 'Unit A')

ggplot(filter1, aes(x= ï..Year, y= Count)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + theme_bw() + labs(title ="Number of students in each level", x = "Unit levels", y = "Count", fill = "Levels") + theme(plot.title = element_text(color="#E69F00", size=19, face="bold.italic"), axis.title.x = element_text(color="#009E73", size=12), axis.title.y = element_text(color="#009E73", size=12))
```

# Is this relationship linear?
```{r}
plot(standard$ï..Year, standard$Count, main="Count vs Year")
Count = standard$Count
Year = standard$ï..Year
mod = lm(Count ~ Year)
summary(mod)
abline(a=17.938, b=-0.003, col="Blue", lwd=3)
```

# Is the Count of students independent of the year of their enrolment? Tested at p=0.05 to see if the results are statistically significant?
```{r}

```
