*Loading in our libraries and the Dataset*
```{r}
library(tidyr)
library("dplyr")
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
data = read.csv("data/P2, Student_data_standard.csv")
data2 = read.csv("data/P2, Student_data_advanced.csv")
```


*Classification of each Variable*

```{r}
#Dimensions of the data#
dim(data)
#Structure of the data#
str(data)

#Dimensions of the data#
dim(data2)
#Structure of the data#
str(data2)
```

* **Year**: The year studied (2012-2017, both semesters combiend).
* **Domestic/Intl**: Domestic or Internation student.
* **Mode**: A few sentences from a sommelier describing the wine's taste, smell, look, feel, etc.
* **Gender**: Gender of student. For anonymity, the students with neither are coded as female. 
This is the same approach used by the Department of Education.
* **Mode**: Full time (18+ credit points) or part time.
* **Age**: the age band the student falls under: Under 18, 19-21, 22-25, and over 25.
* **Unit of Study**: Name of unit of study. Arbitary unit names used for anonimity and operating under the assumption that 
these names relate to a junior unit of study offered by the School of Mathematics and Statistics between 2012 and 2017.
* **Unit of Study Level**: Study level: fundamental, mainstream or advanced.
* **Unit of Study Grade**: Final grade: FA (0-49), PS (50-64), CR (65-74), DI (75-84), and HD (85-100).
For anonimity, other grade descriptions (eg: discontinuations, withdrawals, absent fails) have been removed.
* **Count**: Number of grades with the preceding attributes.
